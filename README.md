# Cloud-Agnostic K3S Cluster with GitOps 

This repository contains the IaC (Terragrunt with Terraform) for setting up a ready cluster based on K3S using Amazon Web Services Cloud Services, Hetzner Cloud or On-Premise (local setup) and connecting GitOps to provision the required Applications and Services for development. 

##  Development

üîß The project is actively evolving, and more code and videos will be added in the near future.

# Prerequisites

- Terraform and Terraform required in your environment (see: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli and https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/) (tested with Terraform v1.5.7 and Terragrunt version 0.77.7)
- AWS CLI with a valid profile (if you want to use SSM-Parameter Store for fetching Secrets and provisioninig AWS resources)
- Git
- A Valid Hetzner Cloud Account with a Token
- SSH Public Key

# Using this code
1. Configure the environment (development) under `envs/dev/env.hcl` and the general project configuration under `root.hcl` 
2. To provision the resources using terragrunt: `bash execution/apply-dev.sh`   (for the development environment)
3. To destroy the resources using terragrunt: `bash execution/destroy-dev.sh`  (for the development environment)
4. Optionally configure additional environments

# üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap and Scope

This roadmap delineates the sequential steps involved in provisioning and managing a K3S cluster across various environments using Terragrunt and GitOps methodologies.

## Infrastructure Provisioning with Terragrunt

- <b>Modular Configuration:</b> Utilize Terragrunt to manage and orchestrate Terraform modules, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- <b>Environment-Specific Setups:</b> Define configurations for different environments (e.g., AWS, Hetzner Cloud, On-Premises) to facilitate targeted deployments.
- <b>Dependency Management:</b> Leverage Terragrunt's capabilities to handle dependencies between modules, ensuring resources are provisioned in the correct order.

## K3S Cluster Deployment

- <b>Lightweight Kubernetes:</b> Deploy K3S, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, suitable for edge and development environments.

- <b>Automated Installation:</b> Automate the installation process to streamline cluster setup across different infrastructures.

## GitOps Integration
- <b>Declarative Configurations:</b> Store Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts in a Git repository to serve as the single source of truth.
- <b>Continuous Deployment:</b> Implement GitOps (Argo CD) to monitor the repository and apply changes to the cluster automatically.


## Application and Service Deployment
-  <b>Helm Charts:</b> Use Helm to package and deploy applications, simplifying the management of Kubernetes resources.
- <b>Integrate Critical Components:</b> Integrate all the required components with GitOps Deployments (GitLab CI, Storage, etc.).
- <b>Monitoring and Logging</b> Integrate monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging solutions to observe cluster health and performance.

## Ongoing Maintenance and Scaling
- <b>Infrastructure Updates:</b> Regularly update Terraform modules and Terragrunt configurations to incorporate improvements and address issues.
- <b>Dynamic Environments:</b> Realization of dynamic environments.
- <b>Cluster Scaling:</b> Adjust the number of nodes and resources in the K3S cluster to accommodate changing workloads.
- <b>Security Enhancements:</b> Implement security best practices, including regular audits, to protect the cluster and applications.
